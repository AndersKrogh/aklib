# aklib

Author: Anders Krogh

aklib is my C library of various functions and templates made over the
years and used mainly in the packages abwt and psearch.

Perhaps someone will find some of it useful, but you should be warned
that I wrote it over 20 years while learning to program.

There is no separate documentation of aklib. Compilation etc is
described in ABWT and psearch.
